<h1>A New Teleological Society</h1>

<h1 id="cybernetics-a-general-definition">Cybernetics: A General Definition</h1>
<br>
<p>There are cybernetic systems all around us. An electric kettle that automatically shuts off once the water inside begins to boil is one example. So is an ecosystem, where the balancing of various species of plants and animals ensure their mutual long-term survival. Dear reader, even you are a cybernetic system, alongside every other living thing. Every thought we have and every action we take is the result of how we have been shaped by our individual experiences. A mundane action like picking up a pen is inherently cybernetic: we choose to do this by moving certain muscles in a certain order, with a certain force that we apply using our sense of touch and pressure. </p>
<br>
<p>Cybernetics can be generally described as the study of purposeful systems that behave in ways regulated by feedback in response to external stimuli. Feedback can be classified as being either &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;positive&quot;, where negative feedback induces behaviors that drive the system towards a desired state, and positive feedback induces behaviors that drive the system away from a desired state. </p>
<br>
<p>In fact, the word for cybernetics originates from the greek word for helmsperson, kybernḗtēs. In this context, the act of steering a ship well (a helmsperson's purpose) requires that the helmsperson maintain a steady course (a desired state) in a changing environment (external stimuli) by adjusting their steering (negative feedback).</p>
<br>
<h1 id="the-importance-of-cybernetics">The Importance of Cybernetics</h1>
<br>
<p>Cybernetic theory began during the second world war, specifically from studies conducted by the mathematician Norbert Wiener on improving the prediction of anti-aircraft weaponry. In order to successfully predict the movements of incoming bomber planes, Wiener was able to condense factors such as the pilot's reaction time, the weather, and other difficulties that would impair feedback into a system that could be quantitatively analyzed. Although his wartime endeavors would ultimately go unfinished, Wiener would bring these formative ideas to produce the foundations of cybernetics in his paper <i>Behavior, Purpose, and Teleology</i>, before formally defining it as &quot;the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine&quot; in 1948 with his book, aptly titled <i>Cybernetics</i>. </p>
<br>
<p>Like many other researchers who worked in similar circumstances during his time, Wiener experienced intense remorse over his participation in the war effort, fearing that science, and in particular his work on cybernetics, would be used to extend our capacity for destruction over a greater understanding of the world. In the years that followed, Wiener brought his cybernetic vision to a different direction: psychology and physiology, which he believed were the furthest from war and exploitation at the time.</p>
<br>
<p>From that point onwards, cybernetics would expand into various areas of scientific, social, and political discourse. While some researchers like Gregory Bateson utilized cybernetic principles to explore our collective impact on the ecological systems we inhabit, others like Donna Haraway took inspiration from the biological-mechanical aspect of cybernetics to propose new ways of thinking about gender, social codes, and identity.</p>
<!-- How can change be enacted, and by whom? What does such a group look like? -->
<!-- How should we act / a cybernetic code of ethics -->
<!-- Notes: -->
<!-- The original teleological society was conceived during wartime, and its findings were used to contribute to suffering rather than helping us understand the world and ways of doing good/living well. -->
<!-- Wiener believed that "As objects of scientific enquiry, humans do not differ from machines" -->
<!-- Since the teleology ("purpose") of an object is defined by its observable behavior -->
<!-- under the gaze of scientific inquiry, human intentionality did not differ from the self regulation of machines -->
<!-- Counterargument: We should not abandon concepts simply because they are not operationally useful to science -->
<!-- My take: I think there is something lacking in Wiener's view of human behavior as one that can be represented through a system or model. Maybe under specific conditions and in certain situations (i.e. from the perspective of a "local" domain), but completely knowing "why" we (at an individual and communal scale) act the way we do is impossible. There is value in concepts since they establish a framework or "lens" from which we begin to comprehend and understand things. At best, a purely cybernetic approach to modeling a system (such as human behavior) can only provide an approximation of the influences at play. This in itself is valuable enough to carefully study and apply the field to the problems we face, although an awareness of what lies outside our knowledge is paramount. In essense, cybernetics is a means to an end, and our end -->
