Since finishing my undergrad at Stevens Institute of Technology, I've finally found the time to write about my experiences applying to graduate programs this year! I'll be breaking down the major steps of the application process that I completed from May 2024 through March 2025, sharing the advice I've picked up along the way. If you're unsure of whether or not you want to pursue doctoral studies, or if you're already preparing your applications, I hope you'll find this article useful; otherwise, I hope you simply enjoy reading it!

**May - June:**

In the summer before my senior year, I spent time making a spreadsheet of the programs I was interested in applying to, and identifying potential advisors whose projects aligned with my interests and experiences. How you approach this step might vary depending on your background and goals. In my case, I wanted to explore research in cognitive science/psychology coming from a background in computer science, so I largely relied on external sources like the internet to find the best programs in those fields, and then filtering for labs that were: (1) looking for new graduate students, and (2) aligned with my profile.

If you plan on continuing your studies in the same field as your undergrad, you should ask your current research mentors (or your academic advisor, or any professors you're close with) to suggest labs that match your interests: this might also come with the benefit of having a stronger recommendation letter if your mentors have collaborated with researchers at those labs, as they can better attest to your research capabilities and sociability.

For each program, I tried to list up to three labs that focused on research I found interesting or relevant to my background. I ultimately applied to ten programs, leading to a total of roughly thirty prospective advisors. I also kept track of the deadlines for each program, any additional requirements such as writing samples, and application fees. Before applying, make sure to check each program's policy on waiving application fees! Depending on the number of programs you're applying to, waivers can save you hundreds of dollars which you can spend on something more important or enjoyable (like coffee and little treats). I've copied the format of my spreadsheet below, but feel free to adapt it to your own needs.

```
| Schools: | Programs:         | Deadlines: | Labs:            | Misc:                   | Fees: |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| School1  | Cognitive Science | 12/1       | lab1, lab2, lab3 | Requires writing sample | $75   |
| School2  | Computer Science  | 12/15      | lab4, lab5, lab6 |                         | $90   |
| ...      |                   |            |                  |                         |       |
```

**July - August:**

Once I compiled a spreadsheet with the labs I was interested in working with, I reached out to each prospective advisor for the possibility of scheduling a brief, informal chat over Zoom. This step isn't strictly necessary, but I found it helpful to connect personally and discuss topics such as the ongoing projects in their lab, their expectations for graduate students, their style of mentorship (ie. whether they tend to be more or less involved), and my own interests and experiences in relation to their work. In hindsight, meeting with a few potential advisors beforehand also helped with my nerves during the formal interviews I had later in the application process, as I was better prepared to speak about my experiences and respond to any questions about my work. Even when a potential advisor couldn't meet, they often responded in a helpful way by clarifying that they were no longer looking for new graduate students (ie. the information on their lab website was outdated). This allowed me to adjust my spreadsheet by removing programs that weren't accepting new students to any of the labs I was interested in. While I was expecting to work with a specific mentor, graduate students in other fields (especially in the biological sciences) might "rotate" between different labs over the course of their studies. If you know that the programs you are applying to work this way, they might still be worth considering. In general, it's best to keep an open mind about the research you might do in graduate school: your interests will likely evolve over time, so being overly selective or inflexible from the start can do more harm than good.

During this period, I also began drafting my curriculum vitae (CVP and the outline for my statement of purpose (SoP). For the SoP, I would recommend framing your prior research experience in a way that builds a cohesive "narrative" of your interests and goals as an academic. In general, you should address: (1) what your interests are; (2) how your coursework and prior experiences have shaped those interests, as well as the skills/capabilities you've attained; (3) why you find the work of certain labs interesting, and how they connect to your background; (4) how attending this specific program will help you grow as a researcher; and (5) how you will contribute to the program's academic community. To elaborate a bit on the last point, you should try to think about how you can be an asset to the program beyond research alone: for example, if you enjoy teaching and want to create opportunities for scientific outreach, then try to emphasize that aspect of your profile! The SoP is arguably the most important part of your application, and should present you as a well-rounded candidate who can contribute to the program in multiple ways.

I won't write much about the CV here as it generally has a consistent, straightforward format. Just remember that it's important to emphasize your research experience, and to clearly list your methods and findings. Try to stick to a minimalist template, and avoid any flashy graphics or styling.

**September - November:**

Early in the fall semester, I reached out to three mentors for recommendation letters and resumed a research project I had paused over summer break. Besides the SoP, the contents of your recommendation letters are among the most important parts of your application. Ideally, if you've completed three research projects under different advisors, you could ask each of them for a letter separately. I only had two, so my third letter came from a professor whose class Iâ€™d engaged with deeply. You can also ask supervisors from internships or jobs, as long as they can speak meaningfully about your skills, work ethic, and personality. It's important to ask your potential recommenders for a letter early in the process, especially if they work in academia. Even if the submission deadlines are months away at this point, your letter writers will be busy during the semester and almost certain to forget unless you periodically remind them. Just don't be overly pushy: after confirming with your recommendation writers, it's best to follow up occasionally without being pushy. Most application platforms let recommenders upload their letters directly, and will notify you when they do.

In the meantime, I focused on maintaining my grades. While research experience is more valuable than a high GPA alone, many programs have cutoffs around 3.0, and stronger profiles often have GPAs of 3.5 or above. Lower grades can be offset by strong research experience, a high GRE score, or for doctoral applications especially, strong performance in a relevant master's program.

**December - February:**

After submitting my applications, I still had to prepare for the next critical step in the application process: interviews. In psychology and the biological sciences, top candidates are usually invited to interview before final decisions. These meetings allow faculty to gauge whether you can sustain a conversation about your experiences and the topics you'd like to study as a prospective student, and to determine whether you would mesh well with the people in their lab. While this might sound scary, most of my interviews were pretty relaxed compared to my expectations going in! As long as you give yourself grace to act naturally, review your past work, and show respect and humility to the people you meet, interviews can be a great way for you to make an excellent impression and learn more about the program.

One highlight I can recall from visiting a department was attending a poster session held by the current graduate students. It was nice to simply talk with them about their work; I was able to think of a few broad ideas for studies based on the research I encountered, in addition to possible collaborations with groups that I hadn't previously considered. Some other advice I can offer is to dress well (I wore a full suit and tie, but that was probably overkill), to send thank-you emails to your interviewers on the next day, and to be courteous to everyone you meet. Lastly, remember to take care of yourself! As an introvert, it was nerve-racking for me to get through each of my interviews, and I remember being completely drained by the end of the day. Even if you don't feel that your interviews went well, you may have ended up doing better than you thought.

**March - April:**

By this point, most programs will have released their final decisions. If you haven't heard back from a particular program by April, check their application portal for updates or reach out to their graduate admissions offices, especially if you have other offers pending. Many schools follow the April 15th Resolution, which allows applicants to wait until April 15th before accepting or declining an offer of admission. Of course, always review the specific policies and deadlines at the programs you've applied to, and to contact their graduate admissions office for any clarifications. When deciding between multiple offers, you'll have to compare the aspects of each program which matter the most to you. Even though I've emphasized "research fit" up to now, I also highly valued the overall sense of belonging that I felt towards each program. Some of these "softer" aspects that I assessed were: (1) whether the faculty in my labs of interest, and in the department at large, seemed supportive and engaged; (2) whether the current graduate students in the department seemed happy; and (3) whether I could enjoy living at the location of the school. Another important factor that I kept in mind was the estimated funding included with each offer: while research alignment is nice, financial security can spare you from a great deal of stress in bad situations, providing a stable foundation for you to power through your doctoral milestones.

**Next steps:**

If you've accepted an offer of admission to grad school, congratulations! I suggest contacting your new advisor sometime over the summer for any recommended readings or other steps that you can do to prepare for the upcoming semester. I also spent some time learning how to use Zotero for managing papers that I'd read or planned to read. Most importantly, take plenty of time off to relax (and in my case, catch up on a year's worth of sleep)!

**Other resources:**

While I was applying to graduate programs, I studied Lucy Lai's comprehensive blog post about the application process here: <https://lucylai.com/blog/gradapps>. It's a great read, with sample application materials and links to other resources, including a Reddit post breaking down what interviewers look for.
