<h1>About<br></h1>
<br>
<p>
My name is Daniel Yu. Among other things, I write software and like thinking about ways of improving our world. I want this site to be a place where I can share and store my thoughts on software development, cybernetics (the study of systems), and anything else that seems interesting or important enough to put down.<br>
<br>

There're a lot of areas that I'm interested in, but here's a few topics which you can expect me to write about relatively frequently:<br>
<br>
• Coding practices<br>
• Free software<br>
• Philosophy<br>
• Injustice<br>
• Ecology<br>
• Internet history<br>
• Education<br>
<br>

Lastly, if you enjoyed one of my articles, please feel welcome to go to the site's <a href="https://github.com/danielyu2003/danielyu2003.github.io/discussions">GitHub discussions page</a> to add a comment. You can also check out some of my other coding projects, or sponsor me (if you were so inclined ☺)!
