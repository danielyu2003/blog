Welcome to my blog! My name's Daniel Yu, and I'm currently a PhD student in cognitive science at Brown University. This blog is a place where I plan on sharing my thoughts about science, technology, art, and life so far.

If you're interested in keeping up with me, or just looking further into the things I've written about, feel free to check out the links that I've listed <a href="/links">here</a>.

See you around!
