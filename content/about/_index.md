Welcome to my blog! My name's Daniel Yu, and I'm currently studying cognitive science as a PhD student at Brown University. This site is a place where I plan on sharing some of my thoughts about science, philosophy, and anything else I find interesting enough to write about.

As a researcher, I'm interested in understanding cognition from an embodied basis, or in other words, how the interplay between our minds, our bodies, and our environments give rise to mental faculties like perception and action.

If you're interested in keeping up with me, or just looking further into the things I've written about, feel free to check out the links that I've listed <a href="/links">here</a>.

See you around!
