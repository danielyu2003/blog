# About

Welcome to my blog! My name's Daniel, and I like thinking about ways to improve our world. I believe in building projects that connect, inform, and empower people, without sacrificing privacy, transparency, or individual agency.

I want this site to be a place where I can collect and share my thoughts on software development, philosophy, society, and anything else that I find interesting! Here's a (non-comprehensive) list of topics that you can expect me to write about somewhat frequently:<br>

Coding practices
• Free software
• Philosophy
• Injustice
• Ecology
• Internet history
• Education
• Anthropology

Of course, any opinions shared here are from my perspective only, and do not reflect the views of anyone I happen to be affiliated with.<br>

If one of my articles happened to interest you, feel free to leave a comment at my site's <a href="https://github.com/danielyu2003/danielyu2003.github.io/discussions"> discussions page</a>! If you want to share an article, or the site in general, first <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%79%75%64%61%6E%69%65%6C%31%33%36%40%67%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">contact me</a> for permission!
