<h1>About</h1>
<br>
<p>
Welcome to my blog! My name's Daniel, and I like thinking about ways to improve our world. I believe in building projects that connect, inform, and empower people, without sacrificing privacy, transparency, or individual agency.
<br>
I want this site to be a place where I can collect and share my thoughts on software development, philosophy, society, and anything else that I find interesting! Here's a (non-comprehensive) list of topics that you can expect me to write about somewhat frequently:<br>
<br>
• Coding practices<br>
• Free software<br>
• Philosophy<br>
• Injustice<br>
• Ecology<br>
• Internet history<br>
• Education<br>
• Anthropology<br>
<br>
Of course, any opinions shared here are from my perspective only, and do not reflect the views of anyone I happen to be affiliated with.<br>
<br>
If one of my articles happened to interest you, feel free to leave a comment at my site's <a href="https://github.com/danielyu2003/danielyu2003.github.io/discussions"> discussions page</a>! If you want to share an article, or the site in general, first <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;%79%75%64%61%6E%69%65%6C%31%33%36%40%67%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">contact me</a> for permission!
